### Attendees

### Design
- Get only information that necessary and make only the API calls that are needed. i.e. frontend will only call if someone needs it and it updated.

- Our first iteration will just be using it to grab in-game data and if they are not in-game will display a page saying "not in game" 

- Go's down-side being parsing JSON. Microservice written in this.
    - Caching microservice
    - --Set chronjob to grab data every few minutes--
- GraphQL exploration.
- Js handle web information.
- Prerendered pages: for when there's too much data.
- CDN: Services that just have a static page i.e. champion pages. Save client time.
- If client can easily do we send data to client to render.
- If heavy data, server can render for client and send the html.

### Focus
- Wireframes to be proviced to help people understand what we are making...
