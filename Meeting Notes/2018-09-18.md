## Meeting with Jaylen
**Action Items:**
- Create and push to GitHub exported Postman collection for LoL API so people can play and get a feel for the API.
    - Add API key internally.
- Create a README that people can edit to put down their recipes (for user story requests/chained API calls).
    - Think of creating a kind of a "broker" to handle these chain-API calls.

---

- For API creation, we want to use [OpenAPI specification](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2017/07/26/the-oai-announces-the-openapi-specification-3-0-0)... but not the tools.
    - Make [Swagger](https://petstore.swagger.io/?_ga=2.180422567.1687375756.1537324837-482758198.1537324837#/) independent from development code. Only use swagger as a documentation.
    - Swagger demands to be the first [middleware](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools/blob/master/docs/Middleware.md), which kind of takes away control, we don't want... can use other things 
    - Use OpenAPI best practices.
- Have a caching service alongside DB.
    - Should it just call caching service?
- Have a "broker" serive for chained API calls.
- OpenShift is overkill, probably won't use it. Just use Docker Swarm/such when we get there...
- Breaking for 3-weeks!
