- Meeting timings, wanted better meeting times. (Just for Christoper)
- Good thing: progress was made...

### Eric
- Needed more guidance on task at hand.
- Need general guideline.
- **Create template or guide for Eric.**

### Cherie
- **Set alarms for meetings so I don't forget them or get to them late.**
- Go over thinking-in-react and flex-box.
- Could have been fixed this by helping Eric earlier.
