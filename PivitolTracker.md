### Icebox
Icebox is where you start storing all your features and ideas throughout the course of the project.

Any new stories usually go there first, so that the Product Owner can devide when and where to prioritize them.

The team can estimate the level of effort for a story represented by the project's Point Scale.

You can click the number of bars to the right of the story titles to choose the number of points estimated for it.

### Backlog & Prioritization
Stories are prioritized by moving them from the icebox to the backlog. The higher they are in the backlog, the sooner they need to be started.

The current iteration shows stories that your team have started, or should be able to start, in this iteration. Which stories fit in the current iteration is based on your project velocity.

Below your current iteration are your future iterations. If you'd like to split out your future iteration stories from current, click the ellipsis icon at the top of the panel, then click "Split current & backlog".

### Story Workflow
Developer can start, finish, and finally deliver the story when the feature is ready for review.

Tracker is built for a collaborative process with emphasis on constant feedback. So a story isn't done until the product owner tries it out and accepts it. If it gets rejected, a comment should be added with the reason, so it can be restarted.

### Velocity & Done Stories

Once stories have been accepted and the current iteration has ended, they move into the Done panel and your project's velocity is updated

By default, your Project Velocity is an average of the number of story points completed over the previous 3 iterations. Tracker uses your Velocity to automatically separate your Backlog into future iterations, or what we call Emergent Iterations. This helps give your team an idea of how much work they may accomplish in the future, based on what they've already done.
